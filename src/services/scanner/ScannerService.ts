// The scanner contract the rest of the app depends on. Pages import

// lib/mock-scanner.ts directly. Today `scannerService` resolves to
// MockScannerService; swapping in BioZoomScannerService later (see
// index.ts) should not require changing a single page.
//
// These types/methods describe scanner OPERATIONS (check the system, run a
// scan, fetch history) — nothing here mentions WebUSB, serial ports, or the
// BioZoom protocol. That detail lives entirely inside whichever
// implementation class is active.
